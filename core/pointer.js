/**
 * The pointer: rate-based gyro aiming with a learned, per-device axis map.
 *
 * Why rate-based (unchanged from the rebuild)
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Absolute pointing needs an absolute reference; the Wii Remote had an IR
 * camera watching the sensor bar, a phone has nothing to look at. Rate-based
 * aiming — cursor velocity = angular velocity — is what every post-Wii
 * console does for gyro-without-optics, and what the ZIG SIM demo behind this
 * project does. Drift is a non-issue: the cursor clamps at the screen edges
 * and the player self-corrects, like a mouse at the edge of a desk.
 *
 * Why NOTHING here assumes a gyro axis convention
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * Browsers genuinely disagree about `rotationRate`: which reported component
 * corresponds to which body axis, which sign, and even the unit (deg/s vs
 * rad/s — a 57× difference). Assuming the spec's labels produced a bug where
 * swinging up moved the cursor sideways: a 90° axis confusion, invisible in
 * any simulation that assumes the same convention as the code. This project
 * has now been burned three separate times by hand-derived conventions.
 *
 * So the device's convention is *learned*, not assumed:
 *
 *   1. Ground truth: body angular velocity computed from consecutive
 *      orientation attitudes. Convention-free by construction — it comes from
 *      the attitude matrix itself. Lagged and noisy, but always pointing the
 *      right way. Until the gyro is trusted, smoothed ground truth drives the
 *      cursor directly, so the axes are correct on every device from the
 *      first second (merely a little softer).
 *
 *   2. Learning: each reported gyro component is correlated against each true
 *      body axis over windows of real motion. That yields a per-axis mapping
 *      (which column, which sign, what scale) — permutation, mirroring and
 *      units all absorbed at once. Reported samples are compared against
 *      slightly-delayed truth so the orientation estimate's lag cannot bias
 *      the correlation.
 *
 *   3. Trust gate: the mapping is only used once its predictions actually
 *      match the ground truth (small residual). A device that reports
 *      something unlearnable simply stays on ground-truth rates — degraded
 *      latency, never wrong directions.
 *
 * The screen mapping is geometric, computed fresh from the live attitude:
 *   yaw   = ω · up            (turning about world-up: left/right)
 *   pitch = ω · right          right = forward × up, forward = whichever beam
 *                              axis (top edge or back) is most horizontal
 * which makes it grip-agnostic — flat, upright, or landscape — with no
 * calibration step.

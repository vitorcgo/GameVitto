/**
 * Calibration — measure the player's grip instead of assuming one.
 *
 * The naive approach treats the phone's top edge as the aim axis and reads yaw
 * off `alpha`. That works only for the grip you happened to assume. Hold the
 * phone upright like a TV remote and the top edge points at the ceiling: that's
 * the gimbal singularity, yaw stops meaning anything, and swinging sideways
 * moves the cursor *not at all*. It's a silent failure — data streams at 60Hz
 * and the cursor simply won't go left or right.
 *
 * So we measure:
 *   1. Wait until the phone is genuinely still, then snapshot that pose.
 *   2. Pick whichever body axis is closest to horizontal — that's what the
 *      player is actually pointing with. Flat-in-palm grips resolve to the top
 *      edge; upright remote grips resolve to the phone's back.
 *   3. Build an orthonormal frame (forward/right/up) around it, so every angle
 *      is measured relative to the player's own neutral pose. That puts the
 *      singularity a full 90° away from where they're actually holding it.
 *   4. Watch practice swings, size the mapping to their real range, and re-zero
 *      at the centre of it.
